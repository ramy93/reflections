See bash_profile_course for things I pasted into .bash_profile

IN ~ directory, .bash_profile has a lot of control of terminal


git diff commit1 commit2        : checks out difference between commits


git checkout  commit    : this will make the commit number you input the most recent commit
*** REMEMBER TO SAVE THE NUMBER OF THE MOST RECENT COMMIT BEFORE USING GIT CHECKOUT



#### Lesson 2  #### 

Initializing a repository

Initial commit will appear if there is no other commit

Untracked files will appear (all files in the directory that you created a new repository)


Staging area- area where you can add files to be added into a commit 


git init  - create initial repository

git add - add to staging area

git status - check the status of this staging area?



Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: It is different because it is an intermediary area
