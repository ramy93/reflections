#### Lesson 2  #### 

Initializing a repository

Initial commit will appear if there is no other commit

Untracked files will appear (all files in the directory that you created a new repository)


Staging area- area where you can add files to be added into a commit. It is also a copy of most recent commit

git add [file]   will add file to staging area

git status       will check the status of your repository, ex. what is in the staging area, what is untracked

git commit [file]  will create a commit
