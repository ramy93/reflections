The first reflection I am posting is about adding a file onto github rather than my local git repository. There are
several reasons why I would do this. For instance, if I want to edit a project but do not have access to my local computer. Or, someone else could be working on a project with me, and would like to add new commits. 

Adding a remote to my local git repository to a newly created github repository:

git remote add [name_of_remote (usually first is called origin?)] [https://github.com/..]


to push my master branch into this new remote:

git push origin master


to pull content from my remote into my local master branch:

git pull origin master

NOTE: TO CLONE ANY repository from github to my local machine: git clone [url] as shown below 

git clone https://github.com/ramy93/recipes.git
